# LangChain Classic Documentation (Unofficial)

This repository contains an **unofficial** reference site for `langchain-classic`.
The official LangChain documentation for `langchain-classic` currently shows
“under construction,” so this project was created to provide a practical,
workable reference built from local package sources.

> **Created with Codex**  
> This documentation was generated and organized using **OpenAI Codex**.

## What’s included
- A static HTML reference site for `langchain_classic/*` modules.
- Expanded summaries, usage notes, and multi‑level examples (beginner/intermediate/advanced).
- Light/Night/System theme support and a simple UI layout.

## How to view
Because the UI loads module content dynamically, serve the folder with a local web server:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Notes
- This is **not** an official LangChain document.
- Content is derived from local package sources in `langchain_classic`.
